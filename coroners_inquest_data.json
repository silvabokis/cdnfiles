Items could have been removed to prevent further self harm or suicide attempts by Steven had this been facilitated by contacting OSCAR1. It is unclear from the evidence given whether Steven would have been placed on constant observations as this is assessed on a case by case basis. It would appear from the earlier incident on 25th March 2023 that Steven's mental health was deteriorating and in fact he was looking for an opportunity to hurt himself or end his life. There is no evidence available to suggest whether the metal observation panel was broken prior to 25th March 2023. It is the belief of the jury that the checks seen in the CCTV were not carried out to the proper standard and it is the belief that there was a failure to inform the healthcare team of the telephone ligature attempt.","AppointmentId":16804,"MasterRecordId":"C56388","StartDateTime":"2024-11-19T10:00:00","EndDateTime":"2024-11-19T12:00:00","DurationInDays":1,"CourtroomFullAddress":"Woburn Street,
