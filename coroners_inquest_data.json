that the failure to call OSCAR 1 after the telephone cord incident directly impacted Steven and this did not allow for a further ACCT review to take place and enable the removal of ligature material to be assessed, support to be put in place, observations to be increased and a full risk assessment to be carried out. Items could have been removed to prevent further self harm or suicide attempts by Steven had this been facilitated by contacting OSCAR1. It is unclear from the evidence given whether Steven would have been placed on constant observations as this is assessed on a case by case basis. It would appear from the earlier incident on 25th March 2023 that Steven's mental health was deteriorating and in fact he was looking for an opportunity to hurt himself or end his life. There is no evidence available to suggest whether the metal observation panel was broken prior to 25th March 2023. It is the belief of the jury that the checks seen in the CCTV were not carried out to the proper standard and it is the belief that there was a failure to inform the healthcare team of the telephone ligature attempt.","AppointmentId":15654,"MasterRecordId":"C56388","StartDateTime":"2024-01-18T15:00:00","EndDateTime":"2024-01-18T16:30:00","DurationInDays":1,"CourtroomFullAddress":"Woburn Street,

evening of 4 April 2024, the deceased visited her cousin. She complained of feeling tightness in her chest and being more breathless than usual. She was advised by her cousin to call 111 when she got home and an ambulance if she got worse. The deceased’s brother picked her up because she told him she was unwell, and he drove her home. The next day, on 5 April 2011, after receiving no reply to his text message, her brother went to the deceased house where he found her collapsed on the floor. There were signs of drug use in the lounge and there were empty alcohol bottles in the deceased bedroom. She was pronounced dead at 18:40 by paramedics. \r\n\r\nThe deceased had accessed mental health services. She had been diagnosed with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, Recurrent Depressive Disorder and ADHD, and had a history substance misuse of cocaine. She was not an intravenous drug user. She was prescribed and took medication for her depression and for ADHD. There was a family history of fatal cardiac arrests. This family history and long term cocaine use, along with taking prescription medication for ADHD (which contained a type of amphetamine) are factors which are likely to have contributed to the acute cardiotoxicity which caused her death.","AppointmentId":16525,"MasterRecordId":"C58357","StartDateTime":"2024-06-26T09:00:00","EndDateTime":"2024-06-26T09:15:00","DurationInDays":1,"CourtroomFullAddress":"Woburn Street, Ampthill,

She complained of feeling tightness in her chest and being more breathless than usual. She was advised by her cousin to call 111 when she got home and an ambulance if she got worse. The deceased’s brother picked her up because she told him she was unwell, and he drove her home. The next day, on 5 April 2011, after receiving no reply to his text message, her brother went to the deceased house where he found her collapsed on the floor. There were signs of drug use in the lounge and there were empty alcohol bottles in the deceased bedroom. She was pronounced dead at 18:40 by paramedics. \r\n\r\nThe deceased had accessed mental health services. She had been diagnosed with Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, Recurrent Depressive Disorder and ADHD, and had a history substance misuse of cocaine. She was not an intravenous drug user. She was prescribed and took medication for her depression and for ADHD. There was a family history of fatal cardiac arrests. This family history and long term cocaine use, along with taking prescription medication for ADHD (which contained a type of amphetamine) are factors which are likely to have contributed to the acute cardiotoxicity which caused her death.","AppointmentId":16541,"MasterRecordId":"C58357","StartDateTime":"2024-10-22T14:00:00","EndDateTime":"2024-10-22T15:30:00","DurationInDays":1,"CourtroomFullAddress":"Woburn Street, Ampthill, Bedfordshire, MK45 2HX","CourtroomAddress":{"HouseNumber":null,"HouseName":null,"Street":"Woburn Street","District":null,"Town":"Ampthill","County":"Bedfordshire","Country":null,"Postcode":"MK45 2HX","Uprn":null,"NameBeforeNumber":false,"FullAddress":"Woburn Street, Ampthill, Bedfordshire, MK45 2HX","Populated":true},"Coroner":"Saoirse TOWNSHEND","InquestAppointmentStatusValue":3,"InquestAppointmentStatus":"Set","AppointmentType":"Case Inquest Hearing","InquestOpeningDate":"2024-06-26T00:00:00","InquestConclusionDate":"2024-10-22T16:45:00","InquestShortFormConclusionValue":1048576,"InquestShortFormConclusion":"Narrative Conclusion"},{"FullName":"John Edmund ADLINGTON","AgeInMinutes":41097600,"Age":78,"DateTimeOfDeath":"2024-09-19T00:00:00","PlaceOfDeath":{"Type":2,"Description":null,"Town":"Dunstable","Organisation":{"Id":127573,"Description":"Caddington Grove Care Home"},"Address":{"HouseNumber":null,"HouseName":null,"Street":"175 London Road","District":null,"Town":"Dunstable","County":"Bedfordshire","Country":null,"Postcode":"LU6 3DX","Uprn":null,"NameBeforeNumber":false,"FullAddress":"175 London Road, Dunstable, Bedfordshire, LU6 3DX","Populated":true}},"DeceasedAddress":{"HouseNumber":"21","HouseName":"Silverleat","Street":"Lockhart Close","District":null,"Town":"Dunstable","County":"Bedfordshire","Country":null,"Postcode":"LU6 3EF","Uprn":"GB|RM|B|14281328","NameBeforeNumber":true,"FullAddress":"Silverleat, 21 Lockhart Close, Dunstable, Bedfordshire, LU6 3EF","Populated":true},"DeceasedDateOfBirth":"1946-07-31T00:00:00","JuryRequired":false,"InquestClosureDate":"2024-10-24T15:18:48.6733333","IsRestricted":false,"InquestNarrativeConclusion":null,"AppointmentId":16711,"MasterRecordId":"C59159","StartDateTime":"2024-10-23T09:00:00","EndDateTime":"2024-10-23T09:15:00","DurationInDays":1,"CourtroomFullAddress":"Woburn Street, Ampthill, Bedfordshire, MK45 2HX","CourtroomAddress":{"HouseNumber":null,"HouseName":null,"Street":"Woburn Street","District":null,"Town":"Ampthill","County":"Bedfordshire","Country":null,"Postcode":"MK45 2HX","Uprn":null,"NameBeforeNumber":false,"FullAddress":"Woburn Street, Ampthill, Bedfordshire, MK45 2HX","Populated":true},"Coroner":"Emma WHITTING","InquestAppointmentStatusValue":3,"InquestAppointmentStatus":"Set","AppointmentType":"Inquest Opening","InquestOpeningDate":"2024-10-23T00:00:00","InquestConclusionDate":"2024-10-23T16:46:00","InquestShortFormConclusionValue":16,"InquestShortFormConclusion":"Industrial disease"},{"FullName":"James Christopher BOLTON","AgeInMinutes":21454560,"Age":40,"DateTimeOfDeath":"2024-09-12T08:49:00","PlaceOfDeath":{"Type":1,"Description":null,"Town":"Dunstable","Organisation":null,"Address":{"HouseNumber":"32","HouseName":null,"Street":"Buckwood Avenue","District":null,"Town":"Dunstable","County":"Bedfordshire","Country":null,"Postcode":"LU5 4PE","Uprn":"GBR|14259081","NameBeforeNumber":false,"FullAddress":"32 Buckwood Avenue, Dunstable, Bedfordshire, LU5 4PE","Populated":true}},"DeceasedAddress":{"HouseNumber":"32","HouseName":null,"Street":"Buckwood Avenue","District":null,"Town":"Dunstable","County":"Bedfordshire","Country":null,"Postcode":"LU5 4PE","Uprn":"GBR|14259081","NameBeforeNumber":false,"FullAddress":"32 Buckwood Avenue, Dunstable, Bedfordshire, LU5 4PE","Populated":true},"DeceasedDateOfBirth":"1983-11-28T00:00:00","JuryRequired":false,"InquestClosureDate":"2025-01-22T12:52:54.8566667","IsRestricted":false,"InquestNarrativeConclusion":"James Bolton died due to hanging.

Items could have been removed to prevent further self harm or suicide attempts by Steven had this been facilitated by contacting OSCAR1. It is unclear from the evidence given whether Steven would have been placed on constant observations as this is assessed on a case by case basis. It would appear from the earlier incident on 25th March 2023 that Steven's mental health was deteriorating and in fact he was looking for an opportunity to hurt himself or end his life. There is no evidence available to suggest whether the metal observation panel was broken prior to 25th March 2023. It is the belief of the jury that the checks seen in the CCTV were not carried out to the proper standard and it is the belief that there was a failure to inform the healthcare team of the telephone ligature attempt.","AppointmentId":16804,"MasterRecordId":"C56388","StartDateTime":"2024-11-19T10:00:00","EndDateTime":"2024-11-19T12:00:00","DurationInDays":1,"CourtroomFullAddress":"Woburn Street,
