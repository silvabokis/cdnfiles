    "Regional_Prediction_Summary": "In Sub-Saharan Africa, Immigration Lawyer currently faces Very Low AI replacement risk at 5.58%. Immigration lawyers are beginning to leverage mobile-first AI tools to overcome infrastructure limitations and manage documentation challenges more effectively. These technologies help digitize paper-based processes and track regional economic community agreements while lawyers provide crucial personal advocacy and navigate traditional legal systems. AI assists with basic translation and form completion, freeing lawyers to focus on complex refugee situations and humanitarian cases. By 2027, we project this risk will remain minimal at 10.04%, reaching 11.72% by 2028, with AI serving as an enabler that helps lawyers deliver justice in challenging environments rather than replacing their essential human role."
