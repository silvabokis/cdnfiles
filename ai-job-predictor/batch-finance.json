By 2027, we project this risk will increase to 109.19%, though this likely represents role transformation rather than elimination. By 2028, reaching 127.39% (capped at 100% in practice) due to advanced AI capabilities in market analysis and automated portfolio rebalancing. The key challenge will be differentiating human value in relationship management and complex financial planning."
