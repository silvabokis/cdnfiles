    "Regional_Prediction_Summary": "In Europe, Photographer currently faces Low AI replacement risk at 23%. Strong artistic traditions and cultural value for human creativity provide protection.

Wedding, event, and documentary photography sectors show strongest resistance due to emphasis on human connection and presence."
